This project contains code MATLAB code for a simple MLP. It was written for experimentation purposes and is not meant to be a robust tool for PDP modeling.

Run the code using **START.m**. This script will pass a model architecture to **MLP.m**, which trains up a network and return training performance information. 

Model error is evaluated using either SSE for linear output units or Cross-Entropy Error for sigmoid output units. The output unit type can be edited in the START.m script.
